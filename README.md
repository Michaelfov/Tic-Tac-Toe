This game is my first project as a beginner.

It includes the basic html, css, javascript, and jquery language.

I've tried several different ways to operate the game.

The logic of AI is line by line but there still have some bugs. For example, if player selected [0] and [8],
ai don't have defence logic for our next move.

You can have a try with it!
